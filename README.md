# Movie-Recommendation-System

# Introduction
In the era of digital streaming, the sheer volume of movie content available to viewers can be overwhelming. This is where recommender systems come into play, serving as a critical tool in enhancing user experience and engagement. These systems, employed by leading streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, utilize sophisticated algorithms to sift through vast libraries, offering personalized content suggestions to viewers. The secret behind their uncanny ability to predict what you might enjoy next is not magic but science - the science of recommendation algorithms.

The importance of these systems in today's technology-driven world cannot be overstated. They are not only a cornerstone in user experience enhancement but also play a pivotal role in driving the economic success of streaming platforms. By aligning viewers with content that resonates with their preferences, recommender systems increase user satisfaction, platform loyalty, and, consequently, revenue generation.

# Problem Statement
EA has put forth a challenge that sits at the heart of this technological marvel: the creation of a movie recommendation algorithm. The task is to develop a system based on content or collaborative filtering capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet seen, based on their historical preferences.

The challenge involves navigating through the complexities of user preferences and movie features to build a model that not only understands these dynamics but also makes precise predictions. The success of this system is measured not just by its accuracy but also by its robustness and ability to adapt to diverse user tastes.

The ultimate value of achieving this goal is immense. A functional and efficient recommender system will revolutionize the user experience, guiding them to movies they are likely to enjoy but might not have discovered otherwise. Itâ€™s about connecting users with movies that match their taste, thereby enhancing user engagement, increasing platform usage, and driving revenue growth for streaming services.

# Data Description
Runtime and Budget Data: The dataset includes features like the runtime and budget of movies, which are likely used in the recommendation algorithm.
Objective
Recommendation Algorithm Development: The project aims to develop a movie recommendation system capable of predicting user ratings for unseen movies based on historical preferences.

# Methodology
Cosine Similarity: Utilization of cosine similarity to measure the likeness between movies or users.
Recommendation Function: Implementation of a function to generate movie recommendations.
Use of Surprise Library: Employment of the 'Surprise' library for handling recommendation system algorithms.

# Technologies and Tools Used
Python: Primary programming language used for the project.
Data Preprocessing: Conversion of data types and handling of strings in the dataset.
Surprise Framework: Usage of the 'Surprise' framework, a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems.

# Results and Evaluation
Model Testing: Testing the model using a 10% hold-out test set.
Predictions: Generating predictions to evaluate the model's performance.

# Code and Notebook
